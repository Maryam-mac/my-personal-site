I am a PhD student in the [College Of Science & Mathematics](https://csm.rowan.edu/departments/math/), [Computer Science Department](https://csm.rowan.edu/departments/cs/), at Rowan University. My research is on distributed systems, cyber systems, and networks. I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Nikolay Ivanov](https://nick-ivanov.com/). I work in the [Research Laboratory for Advanced Cyber Systems and Usable Security (ACSUS Lab)](https://acsuslab.org). More detailed info available in [my CV (May 2024)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mhde7b27v8llmllqupxlt/CV_Maryam.pdf?rlkey=afx9ettxcdqeya7dfjgtyc8m4&st=lsf6jfel&dl=0).

## Research

---

My research is in distributed systems, blockchain technology, and usable systems security. More specifically, I am working on resolving the Byzantine Generals Problem and creating a stochastic verification framework. I am also conducting joint work to find an alternative to random memorable seeds for private key generation. As well as to predict the likelihood of out-of-gas errors in the Ethereum Blockchain with a supervised ML model.
