My research is in distributed systems, blockchain technology, and usable systems security. More specifically, I am working on resolving the Byzantine Generals Problem and creating a stochastic verification framework. I am also conducting joint work to find an alternative to random memorable seeds for private key generation. As well as to predict the likelihood of out-of-gas errors in the Ethereum Blockchain with a supervised ML model.
